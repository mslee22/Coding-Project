The data for this project has been extracted from [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings). Unlike the CWUR rankings we used in P12, the QS rankings dataset has various scores for the universities, and not just the rankings. This makes the QS rankings dataset more suitable for plotting (which you will be doing a lot of!).\n",

    "In this project, you'll have to dump your DataFrame to a SQLite database. You'll answer questions by doing queries on that database. Often, your answers will be in the form of a plot. Check these carefully, as the tests only verify that a plot has been created, not that it looks correct (the Gradescope autograder will manually deduct points for plotting mistakes)."

    "You **may not** hardcode indices in your code. You **may not** manually download **any** files for this project, unless you are **explicitly** told to do so. For all other files, you **must** use the `download` function to download the files.\n",

If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Functions:\n",
    "- `download`\n",
    "- `bar_plot`\n",
    "- `scatter_plot`\n",
    "- `horizontal_bar_plot`\n",
    "- `pie_plot`\n",
    "- `get_regression_coeff`\n",
    "- `get_regression_line`\n",
    "- `regression_line_plot`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `conn`\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** write SQL queries to solve the questions in this project, unless you are **explicitly** told otherwise. You will **not get any credit** if you use `pandas` operations to extract data. We will give you **specific** instructions for any questions where `pandas` operations are allowed. In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **must** close the connection to `conn` at the end of your notebook.\n",
    "* Do **not** use **absolute** paths such as `C://mdoescher//cs220//p13`. You may **only** use **relative paths**.\n",
    "* Do **not** hardcode `//` or `\\` in any of your paths. You **must** use `os.path.join` to create paths.\n",
    "* Do **not** leave irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.\n",
    "* **Avoid** calling **slow** functions multiple times within a loop.\n",
    "* Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.\n",
